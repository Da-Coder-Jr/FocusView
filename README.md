# FocusView
A free, browser-only tool that gives you a one-time link; when someone clicks it they choose to share their current tab, and you watch the live feed in a secure dashboard â€” real-time visibility to keep people on task.

The **docs/** folder contains the entire static site. Open `docs/index.html` locally or point GitHub Pages at that folder so the site appears at `https://<user>.github.io/FocusView/`. A small `index.html` in the repository root simply redirects visitors to `docs/`.

Run `npm test` for a quick self-check. No dependencies are required.
