# FocusView
A free, browser-only tool that gives you a one-time link; when someone clicks it they choose to share their current tab, and you watch the live feed in a secure dashboardâ€” Real-time visibility to keep people on task.

See `assistant/` for a small Node.js/WebRTC demo implementation.
Run `npm install` then `npm start` inside that directory to try it locally.
Run `npm test` there to verify the Node environment.
You can host it on any Node-friendly service (e.g., Render or Railway).
The generated share links are one-use and expire after ten minutes.
