# FocusView
A free, browser-only tool that gives you a one-time link; when someone clicks it they choose to share their current tab, and you watch the live feed in a secure dashboardâ€”Real-time visibility to keep people on task.

The **docs/** directory contains a static version that works on GitHub Pages using the free PeerJS Cloud server. Open `docs/index.html` directly or enable GitHub Pages on that folder.

A Node.js demo with Socket.io is still available in `assistant/` if you prefer running your own server. Run `npm test` there to check your Node environment.
